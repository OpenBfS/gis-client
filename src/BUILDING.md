# Building the application with Sencha Cmd

## Prerequisites

* Sencha Cmd v6.7 (works at least with 6.7.0.63)
* git
* node, npm
* Ext 6.2

## Install Ext 6.2

* just extract an ext package into `src/ext`

## Initialize the submodules, install dev packages

* `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* `cd src`
* `npm install`

## Development with docker-compose

With docker-compose, you just need to run `docker-compose up` to get everything
up and running. This will give you an nginx based reverse proxy for all required
services (Geoserver, GNOS, print etc.) on localhost.

If you need proper namespace support, alter line 190 in `Application.js` to

`url: namespace.href.replace('bfs-docker', 'localhost'),`

Keep in mind that you still need to run `sencha app build development` once in
order to get the GeoStyler.

## Development manual setup

* `cd src`
* `sencha app watch`

Note that the `sencha app install` step is not needed any more. You still
need an additional `sencha app build` at least once in order to build
the Geostyler.

Adapt the `index.html` and toggle lines 44/45 (`appContext.json` location).

The application now runs at [http://localhost:1841](http://localhost:1841)

In order to get (almost) everything to work locally, it is advised to reverse
proxy everything into a single host and adapt the `appContext.json` accordingly.
For nginx the following snippets might be useful:

```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1841;
}

location /ogc {
  proxy_set_header Authorization "Basic base64encodedcredentialshere";
  proxy_set_header Origin "";
  proxy_pass http://local-geoserver-installation/ogc;
}
location /geonetwork {
  proxy_set_header Authorization "Basic base64encodedcredentialshere";
  proxy_pass http://local-gnos-installation/geonetwork;
}
```

This is necessary because:

* authorization works different in production (Shibboleth) and the client does not have the credentials
* access to certain resources (Geoserver REST API, GNOS REST API) needs everything on the same domain
* extracting the CSRF token for GNOS needs access to iframe cookies

## Production

* have a look at the `.gitlab-ci.yml` on how to produce a production build
